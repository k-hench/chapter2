# Code repository for: *Ancestral variation, hybridization and modularity fuel a marine radiation*

This project contains the original bioinformatic analysis behind the paper *Ancestral variation, hybridization and modularity fuel a marine radiation* Hench, McMillan and Puebla.

It covers all steps from genotyping based on raw sequencing data, over population genetic analysis to the final plotting of the figures and compilation of tables used within the publication.

A more extensive documentation of the individual steps can be found  in the `./docs` folder and is also hosted under the accompanying [github page](https://k-hench.github.io/chapter2/).

There are two more accompanying repositories for this publication:
- The ENA sequencing repository: contains the raw sequencing data (Accession Nr: PRJEB35459)
- The [dryad data repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mmt): contains the genotypes and some intermediate population genetic results

There is an additional [**R** package](https://k-hench.github.io/GenomicOriginsScripts/) needed to run the plotting scripts for the figures.
It can be installed using:

```r
remotes::install_github("k-hench/GenomicOriginsScripts")
```
