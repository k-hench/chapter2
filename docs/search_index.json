["index.html", "Script repository (Hench et al. supplement) 1 Intro 1.1 Analysis 1.2 Prerequesites 1.3 Figures", " Script repository (Hench et al. supplement) Kosmas Hench 2020-06-17 1 Intro This repository contains the complete workflow used in the paper “Ancestral variation, hybridization and modularity fuel a marine radiation”. The individual chapters of this documentation follow the separate main steps of the workflow, which each refer to an individual prefix in the git x.x references of the papers method section. The individual steps partly depend on each other - especially git 1 - git 3 should be executed in order and before the other steps. 1.1 Analysis A documentation of the data preparation and the data analysis (git 1.x - 9.x) can be found at: git 1.x: Genotyping git 2.x: Genotyping all base pairs git 3.x: Analysis (FST &amp; GxP) git 4.x: Analysis (dXY &amp; \\(\\pi\\)) git 5.x: Analysis (phylogeny &amp; topolgy weighting) git 6.x: Analysis (\\(\\rho\\)) git 7.x: Analysis (HO ) git 8.x: Analysis (demographic history) git 10.x: Analysis (Stankowski et al. 2019) 1.2 Prerequesites All scripts assume two variables to be set within the bash environment: $BASE_DIR is assumed to point to the base folder of this repository $SFTWR is a folder that contains all the software dependencies that are used within the scripts Furthermore, external dependencies need to be downloaded and deployed at the expected places (s. README.md at the ressources folder). 1.3 Figures The creation of the figures is bundled in a single script (git 11) which can be executed once all nextflow scripts have successfully run. cd $BASE_DIR bash sh/create_figures.sh This is basically just a collection that will run all scripts located under $BASE_DIR/R/fig. Under this location, you will find one R script per figure (and suppl. figure). So if you are only interested in a single figure - that is the place to start looking. Furthermore, a more detailed documentation exists for all the figure scripts used for the manuscript: F1, F2, F3 &amp; F4 as well as for all the supplementary figures: SF1, SF2, SF3, SF4, SF5, SF6, SF7, SF8 and SF9.

It takes the analysis from the raw sequencing data to the genotyped and phased SNPs. Below is an overview of the steps involved in the genotyping process. (The green dot indicates the raw data input, red arrows depict output that is exported for further use.) 2.2 Details of genotyping.nf 2.2.1 Data preparation The nextflow script starts with a small header and then opens the analysis by reading a table with meta data about the samples. The table is parsed and the values are stored in nextflow variables. All indel masks are exported to the resources folder within the root directory. "],
