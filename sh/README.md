# The **bash** folder

This folder contains helper scripts in **bash**.

The scripts are run from within the **nextflow** pipelines in the `nf/` folder.

The file `nextflow_alias.sh` contains the commands used to execute the **nextflow** pipelines.
These commands can be used after running: `source sh/nextflow_alias.sh` from the `./nf/*` sub-folders.
